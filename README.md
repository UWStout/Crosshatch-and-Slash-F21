## Mechanics
-Different Weapons: Loot chests to obtain different kinds of swords! Each weapon will do different amounts of damage, which will make the gameplay easier or harder depending on which you decide to keep.

-Random Damage: Damage is decided by a dice roll similar to what you would encounter in the tabletop game Dungeon & Dragons. A 1d6 will do 1-6 damage, a 2d4 will do 2-8 damage, etc.

-Level Up: After gaining enough experience, you will level up, and for each level you will gain one point to invest in either your Mana or Strength. Mana will add one point of mana to your maximum mana while Strength will add one to your strength. Every 2 points invested into strength will increase your overall damage by 1.
